        <h2>Mission Explained</h2>
        <p class="lead">TURN is a network of student organizations, non-profits and other parachurch ministries who all work toward the same end: <b>getting incoming college students connected to local churches and ministries.</b></p>
        <p>TURN partners with groups at colleges and universities who host a short retreat for students as they enter into their school. TURN seeks to support groups who are well established and are able to host high-quality retreats, develop groups who have the right heart and lack experience in hosting retreats at a high level and launch new groups at college and universities where no such retreats exist. To learn more about what a retreat looks like in practice, <a href="/campuses">check some of them out here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h3>Community Rooted</h3>
                <p>Retreat ministries are a model of community but should not be the primary source for spiritual development. We believe that role is for the local church. We encourage campuses to expect their staff to be fully invested into a local church.</p>
            </div><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h3>Student Driven</h3>
                <p>Our organizational model involves one full time Executive Director whose job is to empower the students to take full control of the work and message of their ministries. By having students lead in various capacities, they learn new skills and take greater ownership in the capacity they serve.</p>
            </div><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h3>Leadership Development</h3>
                <p>Whether in regards to Executive Directors or first year counselors, we want to provide the tools needed to equip student volunteers to function in their role with the highest degree of excellence.</p>
            </div><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <h3>Worship &amp; Celebration</h3>
                <p>We aim to create experiences and opportunities for students to have fun while recognizing that God is the giver of all good things. Worshiping God through the things we do brings glory to His name, and we will continue to celebrate how good He is.</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p class="lead">TURN was established in 2018 by Matt Stone, Taylor Motley, and Josh Dickens. Each founder served as a student director of a <b>campus-based retreat ministry</b> at their respective schools.</p>

        <p>These retreats serve incoming college students by <b>connecting them with local churches and ministries.</b> The experiences they had while serving as student volunteers led them to become passionate about seeing the hearts of college students changed for the sake of the gospel, not only on their campuses, but at universities all across the nation.</p>
        <p>Individual ministries are incredible at affecting the culture of their city, but TURN seeks to unite many campuses together under the goal of welcoming incoming students to local Christian community. Constructive Interference is the idea that when two identical sounds of equal volume are played together, the result is a far louder sound. The same principle applies to TURN; when we work together, the resulting effect is far greater than what we could do alone.</p>
        <p>Josh and Matt continue to lead TURN while Taylor serves as a speech therapist in the Dallas.</p>

This was a full payment for sins, which satisfied both the wrath and the righteousness of God (2 Corinthians 5:21), so that He could forgive sinners without compromising His own holy standard.</p>
