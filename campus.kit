            <p>The retreat takes place at Chimney Point in Westminster, SC which is approximately 40 minutes from Clemson's campus. During their stay, freshmen will engage in small group discussions, worship and speaker sessions, as well as large group games and activities. In addition, our Ministry Fair gives freshmen the chance to speak with local churches and ministries from the upstate. We are passionate about helping freshmen transition to college and aim to support and encourage them in a challenging season of life.</p>
